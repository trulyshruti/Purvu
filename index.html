        <p>Purvu is a social web bookmarklet. To use it, just navigate to an article page, then click on the bookmarklet. A sidebar will appear to the right, with relevant content from around the web: news articles, tweets, and art projects.</p>

<p>The code for Purvu is hosted on your own computer, so you'll need a web server running to use it. Simply download the files, move them to the localhost directory, then drag the bookmarklet link into your browser bookmarks bar. That's it!</p>

<p>Purvu is built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and PHP.  News articles are aggregated from NewsCred, tweets are pulled from Twitter, and art projects are taken from Behance.</p>

<p>Purvu was created as a team project at HackNY in Fall 2012.</p>
