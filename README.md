=====

Purvu is a social web bookmarklet.  No formal installation requiredl simply save the bookmarklet link to your browser bookmarks bar. To use it, just navigate to an article page, then click on the bookmarklet. A sidebar will appear to the right, with relevant content from around the web: news articles, tweets, and art projects. News articles are aggregated from NewsCred, tweets are pulled from Twitter, and art projects are taken from Behance.

Purvu was created at HackNY in Fall 2012 by a team of seven students: Shruti Kulkarni and Julian Bongiorno, from Columbia University; Denis Antipov, Charlie He, and Cathy He from New York University; and Jiankai Dang, from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.
