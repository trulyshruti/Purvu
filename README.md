# Purvu

Purvu is a social web bookmarklet. To use it, just navigate to an article page, then click on the bookmarklet. A sidebar will appear to the right, with relevant content from around the web: news articles, tweets, and art projects. News articles are aggregated from NewsCred, tweets are pulled from Twitter, and art projects are taken from Behance.

The code for Purvu is hosted on your own computer, so you'll need a web server running to use it. Simply download the files, move them to the localhost directory, then drag the bookmarklet link into your browser bookmarks bar. That's it!

Purvu was created at HackNY in Fall 2012 as a collaborative effort by a team of seven students: Shruti Kulkarni and Julian Bongiorno, from Columbia University; Denis Antipov, Charlie He, and Cathy Lee from NYU; and Jiankai Dang and Darshan Pandit, from NYU-Poly.
