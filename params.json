To use it, just navigate to an article page, then click on the bookmarklet. A sidebar will appear to the right, with relevant content from around the web: news articles, tweets, and art projects. News articles are aggregated from NewsCred, tweets are pulled from Twitter, and art projects are taken from Behance.\r\n\r\nThe code for Purvu is hosted on your own computer, so you'll need a web server running to use it. Simply download the files, move them to the localhost directory, then drag the bookmarklet link into your browser bookmarks bar. That's it!\r\n\r\nPurvu was created as a team project at HackNY in Fall 2012.\r\n\r\n[back](http://shruti108.github.com/)","name":"Purvu","tagline":"","google":""}
